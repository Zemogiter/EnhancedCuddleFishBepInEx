# EnhancedCuddleFishBepInEx
A Subnautica mod adding a few tweaks to the adorable fish companion. Orignially a QModManager mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1012), I have ported it to work as a BepInEx plugin after QModManager was retired because of the extensive code changes Subnautica received in Living Large update.

## Current features:

- Display Cuddlefish's position and health on UI, similar to a beacon (will not show when you move far away from Cuddlefish because game unloads it to save on PC resources)
- Interactionmg with Cuddlefish (right click on the fish) will fully restore it's HP

## Planned fetatures:

- None so far
